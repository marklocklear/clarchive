Post is 1956 Epiphone Les Paul Goldtop re-issue. Serial # states that is was made in July of 2006. I had bought this guitar used off of Ebay in the Fall of 2008. I used to play guitar seriously many years ago as I had owned at one time nice vintage Gibsons and vintage amps. I had bought this gear thinking I was going to pick up guitar again, but it didn't happen. The amp is an all tube Crate 5 watt amp. Bought new off of Ebay too. I am including links for both the guitar and the amp for the best descriptions possible. Just a cosmetic note as I did take the truss rod cover off along with the pick guard and treble/rhythm sticker to show off the top more. Plus I changed the control knobs to look like a 1968 re-issue. I had really gotten the idea for looks from the Les Pauls Pete Townshend of the Who would play from 1976-79 (link included). Cash only and serious inquires please.

Phone is =>[]
URL is []
Post is This Sealy posturepedic mattress set is BRAND NEW and has never been used. The set comes directly from the SEALY plant and is still sealed in the ORIGINAL factory plastic bags. It has a 10 year WARRANTY directly from SEALY. The set includes the Queen mattress and the box springs. Every Sealy posturepedic mattress is specially built to eliminate tossing and turning caused by uncomfortable pressure points. This, paired with Sealy's Shock Abzzorber LTD Boxspring that's built to take in weight and motion and provide additional support to extend the life of the mattress, creates a truly comfortable world class sleep system. The suggested retail list price for this posturepedic mattress set is $1,599, but I'm willing to let it go today for just $399. I can help with delivery if needed.

Post is This is an inversion table that works excellent to relieve back or muscle pain.   The brand name is Hang-Ups Inversion Table model: F5000111  I bought this new for $300   This is from a smoke free home and has only been used a few times. I stop using it because I have blood pressure issues. It worked great when I used it and is very theraputic for people with bad backs. This breaks down for storage, but is not a flimsy folding model as I am a large person. Please call me if you would like to come by and take a look at it.   Thanks, 283-3770 Myrna C.

Post is Order your HCG Plus Weight Loss Drops from a Local distributor.   http://www.hcgweightlossforlife.com or http://www.hcgweightlossforlife.org   http://www.shop.hcgweightlossforlife.org   Or Call 907-841-1289 - Melanie   The HCG Diet is Here and it Works   Not all Homeopathic hCG is created equal. We've taken homeopathic hCG and made it better!   We use a broader spectrum Homeopathic hCG 6X,12X,30X,60X plus a homeopathic amino acid complex consisting of (L-Arginine, L-Carnitine, L-Ornithine and L-Tyrosine) in a 3X,6X,12X,30X complex for added weight loss support.   The HCG hormone kicks up the metabolism, by signaling the body to burn more fat. Following the HCG diet protocol your metabolism with operate over 30% a much more efficient level to burn, rather than store. In other diets the metabolism has not changed, and following the diet will continue to run at the same rate, which in most of us dieters has been found to be at only 8%.   HCG opens only the excess fat cells allowing excess fat to be burned. No other time in the human body does this happen, and so other diets often remove fat cells the body needs, causing us to lose in places we don't want to first, and finally where you need it. HCG burns the excess fat cells taking the needed fat, and literally sculpting the body, losing inches as well as pounds.   Homeopathic HCG PLUS   * No syringes or needles, simply a few drops under the tongue (sub-lingual).  * No pharmaceutical drugs  * No prescriptions or physician's consult  * No blood tests  * No hidden narcotics such as phentermine  * No expensive injectable programs  * No refrigeration necessary   * This is the same HCG diet that doctors charge $700 for!  * Lose .5 - 2 pounds per day!!  * Limited hunger on the HCG diet    3 Basic Steps to Losing Weight:  1. Start with two full days of heavy eating, while taking the HCG drops.  2. Continue with the drops and an easy to follow food schedule for at least 23 days.  3. Within the first week, see dramatic results.   Our HCG is Homeopathic and made in the USA in FDA Approved labs.  The HCG we sell is homeopathic. The way the homeopathic HCG is produced is by taking small amounts of the original strength HCG and making it into a sub-lingual mixture which is administered under the tongue. The homeopathic version is then taken 3 times a day to keep the amount of HCG in your body constant. Many prefer the sublingual drops in place of the sometimes painful injections.

Also fits '08 Dyna models equipped with accessory air cleaner covers. Fits EFI models and carbureted models with original equipment CV, Screamin' Eagle CV (except CV51mm Super Bore), and Flatslide carburetors. '06-'07 CVO Electra Glide models require separate purchase of Air Cleaner Cover P/N 29121-07. Air cleaner trim sold separately. Stock on '05 15th Anniversary FLSTF, '05-'07 CVO Softail, '07 CVO Dyna, and '07 CVO Road King models.     Kit is easy to install. Takes less than 30 minutes..

Post is I bought this movie brand new, and only watched it one time. I would appreciate it very much if you'd give me a DVD movie or a good book in exchange for it. But if you don't have anything to trade, you may have it for free.   Edition: Widescreen Leading Role: Scott Wolf, Tim Roth, Gabriel Byrne  Rating: R Director: Keith Snyder  Release Date: Oct 20, 2009 Genre: Thrillers  UPC: 852459002315 Sub-Genre: --   Movie Description:  Scott Wolf stars in this thriller as Emmett Young, a Philadelphia homicide detective who learns that he has a terminal illness and only a short time left to live. While working a bizarre serial killer case, Emmett meets with a shadowy government agent who convinces him that the best way to die is to put out a hit on himself. Surprisingly, Emmett eventually agrees, and hires a hitman to kill him sometime in the coming weeks. Throwing himself into his work, Emmett now struggles to solve his final case before his time is up.   Credits  Cast: Gabriel Byrne, Tim Roth, Khandi Alexander, Scott Wolf   Editorial Reviews  "Roth leavens matters with an enjoyably tongue-in-cheek performance."

There were several of these lining the walls filled with all sorts of dried foods.  This is a large barrel and is quite the showpiece-I always get compliments on it and it starts great conversations. I am moving abroad and cannot bring it with me due to size.   Located in Grass Valley. I can provide a photograph if needed. Come on over and see it!

Post is New with tags. Never worn nor used. Non smoking household so it still smells new. My laptop doesn't fit in the pack so my loss is your score.  Introduced more than a decade ago, our OAKLEY ICON BACKPACK has been copied but never duplicated. To match its cunning efficiency and long-haul comfort, we added features that bring version 3.0 into the digital age  a holster for your mobile phone, a pocket for your mobile music player, an internal organizer for your PDA/GPS-size device, and more protection for your laptop. Extras include every possible convenience we could add to this time-honored invention.  Storage for your laptop (up to 15" widescreen) with side zip access  Contoured shoulder straps with brushed poly-wick lining  Adjustable sternum strap with vertical sliding adjustment  Size: 21" H x 17" W x 9" D / 53.3cm x 43.2cm x 22.9cm Location: McKinleyvilleit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

If your budget allows, purchase new rather than used. Newer cars are more likely to use advanced technologies, such as camless systems, low-friction lubricants, idle-stop, and cylinder deactivation, which shuts down cylinders when not needed. Of course, late model used cars can also feature many of these technologies â and can be a great value. Older cars should not be dismissed out of hand. Purchasing used simply means that you need to be careful that the vehicle has been well maintained. 1GCEC14V86Z108265 181058Location: Valleyit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Phone is =>[]
URL is [["http://www.youtube.com", "http://", "www.youtube.com"]]
Post is I am selling a Line 6 Filter Modeler Pedal. This thing makes the COOLEST NOISES EVER. This was modeled after the famous Korg Synth. See Demo Here:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW7FcIV9rfA   It does MUCH more than shown in the video. Use it musically or really crank it for spaced out effects. I love this pedal, but I am moving to drums, so no point in keeping it around. Unlike most used pedals you'll find online, this one DOES include a power cord.   Here's the description from Line 6:   The Mu-tron® Bi-Phase; the Korg® X911 Guitar Synthare these rebel fighter ships from The Empire Strikes Back? Or maybe proton thrusters from outtakes of Babylon 5? Nope. These, and the other 13 techy tone temptations loaded into Line 6s galactic-purple FM4 Filter Modeler stompbox, represent the outer limits of guitar filter effects, a territory many consider to be todays most fertile terrain for discovering new sounds, timbres and tone colors.   In looking forward, Line 6 first looked back, to the filters, vocoders and guitar synths that players from Frank Zappa and Ernie Isley to Robert Fripp and Peter Frampton have made synonymous with creative guitar playing. The Throbber will have your tone gurgling with synth-approved LFO from four wave shapes, including square or triangle waves; Tron Up/Tron Down literally drips with auto-wah style response in either Low-, Band- or High-Pass varieties; Synth-O-Matic simulates the notably nasty filter sections and wave shapes of prized vintage synths from the Prophet® 600 to the legendary Arp Explorer.   Of course, you already use a filter effect all the time; every Wah-Wah pedal is a variable filter, and the FM4 includes a superb Q Filter that allows you find and fix that golden frequency notch, in the same spirit as parked wah practitioners like Queens Brian May and soul superstar Prince. Want to make it a more traditional wah? Just hook up the optional EX-1 expression pedal, and save a Q Filter sound to both a low frequency (heel down on the EX-1) and a high frequency (toe down on the EX-1) and youve got a more versatile wah than any off-the-shelf pedal, not to mention a pristine 24-bit signal path, stereo ins and outs, and true bypass switching.   Like all Line 6 stompbox Modelers, the FM4 boasts a simple and sturdy front panel design, with four footswitches for saving and recalling your sounds, and six knobs for selecting models and tweaking parameters, with distinct assignments for each knob depending on the model youve chosen. The Line 6 FM4 is for the true explorer of new sonic galaxies; expect to be surprised, stimulated and encouraged to absolute synth-fulness...

Post is Custom Blown Glass ProductsWe carry the infamous killer glass from the Pacific Northwest and across the U.S. Our networks of glass blowers are on the cutting edge of the industry and offer a range of products including: thick glass pipes, heady glass, dope color-changing inside out spoons, inline ash catchers, monster water tubes offering top notch filtration, glass on glass bowls, regular pull slides and more.  "Love Is In The Air"! In 200 words of less, tell us about a family member, friend, or co-worker who really would love a Valentine's Day pipe from Glass Style. Explain why he/she should be selected to win. The winner will be selected through online voting. Just click like under the comment box to register your vote. Love Is In The Air Facebook Contest.  Artists  Meet the different glass blowing artists showcased at Glass Style and learn about their specialties and talents that help make us unique. TAKO - Seattle, WA. Born and raised in Hawaii, Tako learned to blow glass in Santa Cruz, CA. He has studied with many glass masters, including Jason Lee and Marcel Braun. MBG - Bellingham, WA. MBG goes huge just like the mountain they're named after. Sick and thick. REALAZATION GLASS - Eugene OR. These guys pump out some bad ass sculpted tubes that are super life-like down to the last detail. ADAM - Seattle WA. A background in scientific glass blowing, Adam has studied at Penland School of Crafts with masters, including Emilio Santini. B-Dubbs - Skaneateles,NY. When discovering flame working in the late 90's, he became infatuated and has now become a passion that no word could describe.  Collections  Learn more about the different collections of blown glass that we carry including hand pipes, water tools, and a variety of glass accessories.  Our Water tools are all about filtration and diffusion. These products filter and cool the air through water, cleaning out harmful byproducts. Our water tools include water tubes, bong, natural perc tubes, triple perc tubes with diffused trees, ash catchers, inline ash catchers, bubblers, double bubs, natural perc bubs, and oil rig bubs. You won't believe how smooth life can be until you slap some ice water in one of these bad boys.  We here at Glass Style love out water tools; they smooth out the hits because the diffusers break up the smoke into tiny bubbles as it passes through water. The more holes a diffuser has, the more chances the smoke has to get dispersed into tinier bubbles, allowing more surface area to be cleaned. The more percolation, diffusion, and filtration on a piece the better it will function.  Glass Accessories.    Hand Pipes.    Hand pipes are at the core of our collection and a vast category. A hand pipe could be a small glass frit spoon, with bright colors, and fuzzy purple fume clouds that fits into your pocket, a monster heady Sherlock two feet long, with massive horns, or the classic hammer shape, with clean, crisp dichro wig wag lines.  Most people on the go need a hand pipe that fits their lifestyle. We carry many different styles including our frit spoon, which is a great piece and comes in a wide variety of colors. The inside-out spoons have intricate patterns of Venetian cane work (laticcino, filigrana) incorporated into their designs. The large fume spoons color change over time to reveal their inner beauty.  Water Tools.    It's always fun to accessorize! Now you can accessorize your glass pieces with Glass Style, including custom worked glass-on-glass push bowls or ice-pinch bowls. The newest TI pad curves and vape domes will aid your concentration. We also have carbon filter adaptors to keep your water tools cleaner for way longer. Accessories are a fun way to keep your piece fresh and new.  The ice pinch bowl is a relatively new concept; it fixes the age old problem that one-holed bowls have, where the one small hole you suck through that usually gets clogged. Borrowed from the ice pinches on a typical water tube the artist will add the pinches to a bowl, creating a sort of glass screen. The result is max airflow.  You can connect with us on Glass Styles FACEBOOK wall where we interact with our friends and customers.  You can contact us on Glass Styles website.  Thank you for visiting Glass Style.

Post is Runs great  No leaks, smoke, funny noises, overheating, or anything like that.  Cosmetically not perfect but in good shape for it's age  Has a tow package  leather interior decked out with all the power accessories and they're all working. But there's no stereo. willing to include a nice dual flip down with the works sat radio mp3 so on for an extra $50.  Selling as is. clean title, planned non opperation ($70 to bring current)  willing to get it smogged for $1500 thought I'd try to make it easier on myself and cut someone a deal at the same time, take it or leave it.   price is firm books for more than double what I'm asking  209-410-1279   Location: turlockit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Phone is =>[["831", "261", "6751"]]
URL is []
Post is This is a 2007 Specialized Stumpjumper Comp with many upgrades. I bought this bike in February 2007 from my local bike shop and it was ridden until December 2009. Since then it has sat in my garage.   This bike has 3 seasons on it and is in great condition; all parts on this bike work well. There are some minor scratches on the frame that one would expect after 3 years of riding.   The frame size is a 21 inch, which Specialized categorizes as an extra large.  I am 6 feet tall, and with the stem I currently have on, it fits fine.  Depending on stem height, the frame can range for someone 511 to 65  I have invested over $1,300 in upgraded parts and originally spent $1,700 (plus tax) for the bike in 2007. The upgraded parts are: Crankbrother Cobalt wheels, XT cranks, and XO shifters.  The Cobalt wheels where added late in 2009 and have less than 100 miles on them. This bike weights 22 pounds!!   I have spent over 3,000 on this bike and planned on selling it for 2,000; however, it has been in my garage so long, I just want to get rid of it.  I'm asking $1,350. It pains me sell my bike for so cheap.   Call/Text: 831-261-6751  Or email me with the link above.  Feel free to email me for any extra pictures or questions.   I also have a pair of carbon MTB reynolds wheels, a NEW 2011 Trek District, and a NEW 2011 F29 Fox fork for sale.  Email me!

Post is I have (1) K-SUB for Sale, Great Sounding SUB come by and check it out   Im asking $650 for info call/txt Dennis (714)605-0548   Features  Lightweight portable powered speakers with legendary QSC amplifier power and reliability  1000 watt continuous Class D power module  Extensive DSP enhances system performance  Attractive and professional appearance  Rugged birch plywood enclosure  Tour-grade 18 gauge steel grilles  Comfortable ergonomic handles  Threaded pole socket  The KSub is a dual-12" bandpass design, constructed of premium birch and includes high-quality, low-noise casters. The subwoofer features a threaded pole receptacle for a positive, wobble free connection to a threaded speaker pole   Remote gain control capability is offered via a potentiometer (not included) connected to the on-board Euroblock connector. In an installed application, multiple K Series speakers can be "daisy-chained" for total gain control from a single remote pot. Auto-standby mode is engaged after 5 minutes of inactivity.     Extensive DSP  DMT (Directivity Matched Transition) provides for matched LF and HF coverage across the entire listening area, eliminating unnatural "dead" or "hot" frequency zones.  Intrinsic Correction, first featured in our high-end line-array products maps 65-75 spacially-averaged measurements to IIR and FIR filters that actively adjust time, frequency and amplitude response to a maximally flat bandpass target. The result is a speaker that behaves equally well across the entire sound field.  DEEP and excursion limiting allow for extended low-frequency response by actively managing low-frequency transients without degradation of the underlying signal or adjacent frequencies.  GuardRail protection, first introduced on our GX Series amplifiers protects both the amplifier module and your performance from unnatural and destructive clipping.

Post is This is a Sony 5.1 Dolby Digital Home Theater System. This system includes an amp, AM/FM tuner, 5 disc CD changer, dual cassette tape deck, remote control, RCA cables, speaker wire, center channel speaker, two satellite speakers and two floor standing speakers. Cost over $600 when bought new. Everything works! The floor standing speakers have some very small chips in the lower corners, but otherwise these components are like brand new. I no longer have the owners manual, but the system is very easy to use. I bought this when I lived in northern California and had to downsize to a smaller system when I moved to a smaller house in Morro Bay. Will not separate components. Call me if you want to come take a look at it. Jason @ 408*three one three*7756. NO SPAMMERS!!  Location: Morro Bayit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Post is Below is a list of the items for sale in the collection. I would prefer to sell the complete collection, but would be open to offers for individual items. Many items are still in the original boxes and are in very good condition. Some boxes show more wear than others but most are very good. Price based on at least "three recent sales" on ebay to establish a middle of the road price. These items are in at least as good of condition as those sold, many better. Buy local, know what you're getting and save the shipping costs which can add a substantial amount to the actual price paid!

Post is I have this really cool Stolichnaya Strasberi bottle for sale. It is over 3' tall and could be used for decoration or a bank if you wanted. It is a solid top so if you wanted to use it for a bank you would have to modify it. It is VERY heavy plastic, not flimsy at all. Perfect for all you Stoli lovers out there. Great conversation piece for your bar. If you have any questions, feel free to call but only serious callers. I am in Visalia, I can be reached at (209)502-0723 Location: Visaliait's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Microfiber fabric is comfortable, stain resistant and "family-friendly." There is a LIFETIME WARRANTY on the frames and the cushions. You'll find other promotional microfiber sofa and chair groups at stores starting at $699 and up. I'll let this group go right now for just $370. I would prefer that you buy it as a set but I will entertain any reasonable offer to buy each piece separately as well. If you need assistance with delivery, let me know and I can help. .

Post is Rare Endangered Tennessee Fainting Goats 15 weeks old, Healthy Playful and pure bred and MINIATURE, we have two babies  1 female black/white with horns, Mom is tri colored and has blue eyes and no horns, Dad is black/white with horns stocky build and a level 6 fainter (one of the best)  this little girl already stiffens up when held!  1 male black/white with horns, small and stocky (like Daddy), Mom is black/white with horns and is approx 25" tall, Dad is the same as little girls. This is a unique and ENDANGERED breed so higher priced than ordinary goats, PLEASE do research on them and you will find out how awesome this breed truly is and worth every penny.  Need to sell these two babies now due to unexpected job layoff. They can be registered by you. They will be ready to breed in April/May and you could have babies this year.

Post is We are getting rid of our 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier. It is a 2 door automatic trans. It has just over 73k original miles. Clean Florida title.  Clearcoat on the hood is flaking. Could use new window tint. The air conditioner was blowing ice cold last summer. The ac compressor still engages, but no longer blows cold.  It is a good clean little car that gets excellent gas mileage. We just have no use for it any longer. Runs and starts great. The only problem is with the ac not blowing cold.  The previous ad was flagged for no reason. This is not a dealer car! These are the actual pictures of the car! It is in my posession. In fact, it has been in my posession for about 3 yrs!

Post is Loaded! Leather seats, all power acc., power driver seat, power mirrors (also extend/collapse for trailers), towing package, electronic-controlled 4-wheel drive, cold A/C, K&N filter, fog lights, high miles ~184522~ has a 5.3L V8 and gets 17 mpg around town and 21 mpg highway/runs great and a nice ride! Tires are new on premium wheels, excellent paint/no rust, steering wheel controls, AM/FM/CD/Satellite radio, Bose sound, On-Star, a few bumps and bruises (pressure dents that will pull)--4-wheel drive works as it should for a great work truck! The driver's seat is split/worn at the side seam but doesn't affect comfort/controls, rest of the leather throughout is nice! The transmission needs work, the 2-3 shift solenoid went out so won't go into 3rd gear but can drive 45 mph @ ~3000rpm in 2nd--the part is less than $50. but if your not mechanically inclined, you'll want to have it repaired or ideally get the transmission rebuilt (due to high miles). It's served me well but I have too many vehicles/toys, no time and need this truck gone. All reasonable offers considered; books over $10K in fair/average condition (you be the judge); rebuilt transmissions typically run $1500.+ but I haven't priced the local shops. Second owner, I have all maint receipts, Haynes manual and original owners manual. Serious buyers please reply to ad for contact info and times; worth the trip to check out a nice truck!   Here are pictures after a car wash, truck running on a cold sunny day.  Location: 32405it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Post is Up for sale is my 55 gallon fresh water fish tank that is up and running with fish, stand, hood lights, back drop, decorations, fish filter, air pump, fully graveled, The takn measures approx. 4' 1/4" x 26" wide and the stand 51 1/2 " wide x 53 1/2" tall. I talk to pet shops to see what a fair price was to ask for it and they all said $300.00 was a fair price.   I need cash so the first 250.00 gets it. Please see pictures. I have moved into a smaller place and need to find a good home for this set up.  Please call 321-591-2106 Thanks  Location: Lake Washington areait's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Post is 67 ford f100. Great looking truck. Interior redone and repainted exterior yellow.302 engine, not stock, around a 1973 engine. Power steering, automatic. New drive shaft, new 4 brl carb. Runs great but needed a newer vehicle to drive long distances. I drove it everyday for two years and loved it. Paint is in ok condition, the clear coat on the hood is peeling off and has some small scratches. Has 2 small dents on the front left fender but can be fixed. Has glass packs so its loud but sounds great. A wonderful truck for someone who is going to take care of it. Call me at 8505440312 to come take a look at it or for any more questions. Thanks, Ben Location: tallahasseeit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Its perfectly new, plastic protector still on glass, I never removed it out of the box even. Its got all the paperwork and warranty information. I wish I wore watches, I would love this one, I think it looks excellent and expensive. Would make an excellent valentines day present.   Here is a link off their website for the closest match (the colors differ):  http://www.stuhrling.com/popup_zoom.cfm?ItemBImage=107BG_33152_combo_l/&ItemID=1164&zoomifyImagePath=zoom/107BG_33152_combo_l/   If you are interested, send an email with your name, email address or phone number, and make sure you mention Stuhrling Watch... too many craiglist marketers reply with one line questions that are irrelevant. So if you want me to reply, please include that stuff. Location: SW PSLit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Post is I'm looking to trade my 89 Mustang Convertible LX 5.0 For your 95 Camry! Car runs great and has a bunch of new parts. Engine and tranny are smooth with the exception of the valve cover gaskets need replaced (I have brand new ones still in the box) otherwise there are no leaks at all. Oil change was done early this month. Body is decent with surface rust where paint is peeling off but no bubbles/holes. Needs a new top which is about $140 on ebay and needs a new motor which i have the replacement one. Everything is cosmetic that needs to be fixed. We bought my wife a Camry and i enjoy driving it :) I'm in no rush to get rid of my car but if the right camry comes along....... i have pics below to show you the cosmetics of her.   Any other questions, please Text Matt @ 772 - 812 - 6762 Location: PSLit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Post is i have a 87 accord and the engine is good and strong but has a minor oil leak. the reason for selling is that the piece under the dash that the clutch cable connects to is broken and im not sure if it can be fixed or welded or something. i started taking the linkage off and was going to just put a automatic in it but dont have the money or time right now and the land lord is wanting the car gone. the clutch and clutch cable were just replaced also because i thought that was the problem. the rims were just sold so i have steel rims on it with color matching hub caps (5 star) it has a good recent paint job on it and the int. is in fair condition. it has a greddy exhaust on it to. 229 4364183 steven or ashlyn 800 obo just need to get it out of the yard Location: albany, gait's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Post is I have a blue and silver 1987 Chevy S10 2.8L V6 Automatic that runs great! I go out, crank her right up, and take her around the block every once in a while to make sure that it still gets that occasional circulation.. Found that it needs a rear fuel injector ($65 brand new at Auto Zone) and it could use another exhaust manifold, because it has a crack in it, but it doesn't take away from the truck's performance (used-about $80-90). Other than that, it has a couple cosmetic issues but has power windows and power steering. Only has about 108,000 miles on original motor! I have the clean clear title in hand and ready to go. Check out the pics below. I'm asking $1800 (OR best offer), so if you're serious and interested, give me a call, or you can text! I'm really looking to get it sold asap, so even if you know someone that's in need of a good, dependable truck, then please, pass my info along, or just forward this ad to their email! Thanks!   ~Holly  Seven7Zero 8seven5 Five9Eight21800 Location: Norcross, GAit's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests

Post is Hunting Club Special - 240 Acres of Prime Deer & Turkey Hunting - 731-235-3781 - The farm is located in Kentucky's top deer hunting county, Hopkins County.   My neighbor killed a nice 15 point buck that scored 172 with his crossbow in 2009. - Whitetail Deer Hunting Farm - A 20 foot towerstand is centrally located over a nice two acre clover foodplot with pond and mineral station. Pennyrile National Forrest is only a few minutes and the Tradewater river bottom is less than a mile from the farm. I am an active member of QDMA, we are practicing the Quality Deer Management program. We are trying to grow bigger bucks with mineral stations, clover food plots, and letting the bucks live until they are 5 years old or older. We have pictures of several nice deer from the 2010 season. I have spent several thousand dollars with a dozer, tractor work, lime, fertilize and fixing foodplots with trails throughout the farm. A nice creek is the south boundary line, two nice foodplots that pull deer out of the bottom were added this past year.This is the perfect farm for someone that is after that monster buck or one who loves to turkey hunt. I have numerous deer cam pictures and pictures of the farm that I can send at your request. The farm has a nice farmhouse that will sleep ten people, it has central heat and air, all new windows, new carpet and hard woodfloors, dish tv, with every room fully furnished. 2010 for the farm were less than $600. The farm has three nice food plots, a pond and six deer stands that stay with the farm. The farm also has a nice 10X12 new outdoor building with a 15 foot deer skinning tower with water hydron and street light. A fifteen acre soybean field brings in $1500 income for the farm. The tax for This farm has all you need to make this hunting camp for a group of friends and is loaded with deer and turkey.

Tile is =>Unlocking Nintendo Wii (Savannah Ga)
Phone is =>[]
URL is []
Post is If you have a nintendo wii regardless what model or firmware you have and want more out your system then I can unlock it for you. Unlocking the system involves making your system do things it was locked to do such as backup and run games off a external hard drive. Installing games from the wii store. Turning it to a media center. DVD player. Quite a selection. I will not charge to unlock your system. However the only thing that I will charge for is just mainly the time to do everything and games that you would like for me to put on your hard drive. Depending the size of the game is mainly the price I will charge. So bout as low as $1 to as high as $5. I can change your boring white theme in to something that's worth looking at. I can provide you with the tools needed to play your games off a hard drive and to even backup your wii and restore in case something happens to it. Software wise. If you wii gets ran over by a car or something then I can't back that up. Lol. But you get the idea. Email me for details.
